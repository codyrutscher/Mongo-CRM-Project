# Current Status - Prospere CRM

## ✅ Completed

1. **Database Sync**
   - Synced 138,201 contacts from HubSpot to Railway MongoDB
   - Fast parallel sync script created (5-10x faster)
   - Company field included in all contacts
   - Campaign types properly assigned:
     - Buyer: 66,239
     - Seller: 21,649
     - CRE: 459
     - Exit Factor: 8,629

2. **Dashboard Navigation**
   - All 8 dashboard cards navigate to HubSpotContacts page
   - URL parameters pass filters (campaignType, hasEmail, hasPhone, hasCompany)
   - Numbers formatted with commas for readability

3. **Backend Improvements**
   - Added campaignType filter support
   - Added hasEmail, hasPhone, hasCompany filter support
   - Database connection uses RAILWAY_MONGODB_URI fallback
   - Comprehensive logging added for debugging

## 🔧 Issues to Fix

### 1. Filters Not Working (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem:** Clicking dashboard cards shows all 138k contacts instead of filtered subset

**Status:** Debugging logs added, waiting for Railway deployment

**Next Steps:**
- Check browser console for: `📌 Applying URL filters` and `🔵 getContactsWithFilters called`
- Check Railway logs for: `🔍 buildFilterQuery called with filters` and `🎯 Final MongoDB query`
- This will show exactly where filters are being lost

### 2. CSV Upload Not Working (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem:** Uploaded 26k Seller contacts via CSV, but they're not in Railway database

**Current State:**
- Total contacts: 138,201 (all from HubSpot)
- CSV contacts: 0
- Seller contacts: 21,649 (should be ~47k with CSV)

**Possible Causes:**
- Upload failed silently
- Error during CSV processing
- Contacts uploaded to wrong database
- Upload succeeded but contacts were deleted

**Next Steps:**
- Check Railway logs for CSV upload errors
- Look for error messages during upload process
- Verify CSV upload endpoint is working
- May need to re-upload CSV after fixing any errors
