### Comparing HubSpot vs Prospere vs Response Genius

**HubSpot:**
- Check contact properties for the 8 list properties
- Export contacts with those properties

**Prospere CRM:**
- Use Advanced Filters to filter by the 8 lists
- Export results to CSV
- Compare counts

**Response Genius:**
- Check list counts in Response Genius dashboard
- Should match Prospere CRM counts after manual CSV upload

## üìä Database Schema Updates

```javascript
// Contact Model - New Fields
{
  // Response Genius DNC Lists
  dnc___seller_outreach: Boolean (indexed),
  dnc___buyer_outreach: Boolean (indexed),
  dnc___cre_outreach: Boolean (indexed),
  dnc___exf_outreach: Boolean (indexed),
  
  // Response Genius Cold Lead Lists
  seller_cold_lead: Boolean (indexed),

  // Campaign Tracking
  campaignStatus: String (enum: "", "Delivered", "Unsubscribed", "Hard Bounce", "Soft Bounce"),
  campaignType: String (enum: "", "Buyer", "Seller", "CRE", "Exit Factor")
}
```

## üîÑ Webhook Integration

The webhook service (`src/services/webhookService.js`) automatically syncs these 8 properties from HubSpot to Prospere CRM when they change.

**Real-time sync for:**

- Updates happen automatically when properties change in HubSpot
- No manual intervention needed after initial setup
