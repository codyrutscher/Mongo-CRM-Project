# Prospere CRM Updates - Implementation Summary

## Changes Requested

### 1. ✅ Add 8 Lead List Filters
Add ability to filter contacts by these 8 properties:
- `dnc___seller_outreach`
- `dnc___buyer_outreach`
- `dnc___cre_outreach`
- `dnc___exf_outreach`
- `seller_cold_lead`
- `buyer_cold_lead`
- `cre_cold_lead`
- `exf_cold_lead`

**Status**: Properties already added to Contact model. Need to add to frontend filters.

### 2. ✅ CSV Upload Function
Verify CSV upload is working for testing.

**Status**: CSV upload exists at `/contacts/upload` endpoint. Need to verify it's accessible.

### 3. ✅ Campaign Type Dropdown
Rename dropdown from "Contacts" to "Campaign Type" with options:
- Buyer
- Seller
- CRE
- Exit Factor

**Status**: Need to locate this dropdown and update it. Added `campaignType` field to Contact model.

### 4. ✅ Campaign Status Field
Add new field with options:
- Delivered
- Unsubscribed
- Hard Bounce
- Soft Bounce

**Purpose**: Track email campaign results via CSV upload.

**Status**: Added `campaignStatus` field to Contact model.

### 5. ⚠️ Response Genius Sync Issue
Contacts uploaded via CSV to Response Genius are not syncing via API afterward.

**Issue**: Lists may need to be created manually in Response Genius first, or API sync is not working as expected.

**Solution**: User will manually upload CSVs to Response Genius to create lists, then webhook will maintain sync going forward.
