## üéØ Next Steps - Upload to Response Genius

### Option 1: Manual CSV Upload (Recommended)

1. **Log in to Response Genius**: https://control.responsegenius.com

2. **Create the 8 lists** (if not already created):
   - Navigate to Lists section
   - Create each list with the exact API identifier from the table above

3. **Upload CSV files**:
   - For each list, use the CSV import feature
   - Upload the corresponding CSV file
   - Map columns: email, firstname, lastname, phone

### Option 2: API Upload

Once lists are created in Response Genius, run:
```bash
node scripts/sync-8-lists-to-response-genius.js
```

This will upload all contacts via API (may take 30-60 minutes for 398K contacts).

## üîÑ Ongoing Sync

### Real-Time Webhook Sync (Already Active!)

The webhook service automatically syncs these 8 properties when they change in HubSpot:

**DNC Properties:**
- `dnc___seller_outreach`
- `dnc___buyer_outreach`
- `dnc___cre_outreach`
- `dnc___exf_outreach`

**Cold Lead Properties:**
- `seller_cold_lead`
- `buyer_cold_lead`
- `cre_cold_lead`
- `exf_cold_lead`

### Manual Re-sync

To re-sync all properties from HubSpot:
```bash
node scripts/sync-8-properties-from-hubspot.js
```

To re-export CSVs:
```bash
node scripts/export-8-lists-to-csv.js
```

To check current counts:
```bash
node scripts/check-8-list-counts.js
```
