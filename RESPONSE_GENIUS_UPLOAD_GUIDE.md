## üìã Upload Instructions

### Step 1: Export the CSVs
Run this command to create the CSV files:
```bash
node scripts/export-contacts-for-rg.js
```

This creates 8 CSV files in your project root directory.

### Step 2: Upload to Response Genius

For each list, go to Response Genius dashboard:

1. **Navigate to Lists** ‚Üí Find the list by name
2. **Click "Import"** or "Upload Contacts"
3. **Upload the corresponding CSV file** (see table above)
4. **Map the columns**:
   - `email` ‚Üí Email
   - `first_name` ‚Üí First Name
   - `last_name` ‚Üí Last Name
   - `phone` ‚Üí Phone
5. **Select "Update existing contacts"** (this prevents duplicates)
6. **Click Import**

### Step 3: Verify Upload

After each upload, check:
- The contact count increased
- No duplicate errors
- Sample contacts appear correctly

## üîÑ What Happens After Upload

### Automatic Syncing (Webhook)

Once all CSVs are uploaded, your webhook integration will automatically:

‚úÖ **When a contact's DNC/Cold Lead property changes in HubSpot:**
1. HubSpot sends webhook to your Railway app
2. Contact is updated in your MongoDB database
3. Webhook triggers Response Genius sync
4. Contact's list preference is updated in Response Genius

‚úÖ **Supported Properties:**
- `dnc___seller_outreach`
- `dnc___buyer_outreach`
- `dnc___cre_outreach`
- `dnc___exf_outreach`
- `seller_cold_lead`
- `buyer_cold_lead`
- `cre_cold_lead`
- `exf_cold_lead`

### Example Flow

1. You set `dnc___buyer_outreach = true` on a contact in HubSpot
2. Within seconds, the contact is added to the "DNC - Buyer outreach" list in Response Genius
3. If you later set it to `false`, the contact is removed from the list

## üìä Current Counts

**Your Database (as of now):**
- DNC Seller: 100,964 contacts
- DNC Buyer: 72,967 contacts
- DNC CRE: 98,023 contacts
- DNC EXF: 94,217 contacts
- Cold Seller: 8,835 contacts
- Cold Buyer: 27,948 contacts
- Cold CRE: 2,940 contacts
- Cold EXF: 6,746 contacts

**Total: 412,640 contacts**

**Response Genius (from 10/23 upload):**
- ~384,000 contacts (older data)

**Gap: ~28,000 contacts** need to be added

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Duplicates**: Response Genius handles duplicates by email automatically. If an email exists, it updates the record.

2. **New Contacts**: After this upload, any NEW contact created in HubSpot with a DNC/Cold Lead property will need to be added to Response Genius first (via CSV) before the webhook can update it.

3. **Webhook is Already Active**: The webhook code is deployed and running on Railway. It's just waiting for contacts to exist in Response Genius.

## üß™ Testing the Webhook

After uploading the CSVs, test with an existing contact:

1. Find a contact that's in Response Genius (from your upload)
2. Change one of the 8 properties in HubSpot
3. Wait 10-30 seconds
4. Check Response Genius - the contact should be added/removed from the list

Example test contact: `drutscher@gmail.com`
- After CSV upload, this contact will exist in Response Genius
- Change `dnc___buyer_outreach` in HubSpot
- Webhook will automatically sync it

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

After completing these uploads, you'll have:
- ‚úÖ 100% parity between your database and Response Genius
- ‚úÖ Automatic real-time syncing via webhooks
- ‚úÖ No manual intervention needed for future updates

## üÜò Troubleshooting

If webhook doesn't work after upload:
1. Check Railway logs for webhook activity
2. Verify the contact exists in Response Genius
3. Run test script: `node scripts/manual-sync-contact-to-rg.js <email>`
